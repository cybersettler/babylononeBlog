  Babylon One will be the first city in space, and the first self sufficient
  space colony in human history. It will open the interplanetary space
  resources to mankind, and will also be the cradle of the most advanced civilization
  in the Solar System. But first we have to make it happen!

  Babylon One is a huge and daunting enterprise that will be the outcome of a long
  process. The first stage of the process is taking place right now, on the internet.
  This website is part of the first efforts to bring this project to life, and there
  will be a lot more going on the internet. The first objective of the Babylon One
  project is to bring together the people who will be the first citizens of this space
  metropolis and to create a virtual space where the next stages of the Babylon One Project
  are going to be drafted. In fact, this virtual space will become with time a virtual
  version of the space city itself, and hence its name, Babylon VR.

<p>
  The name of the city was mainly inspired by the mid 90s Scifi TV series
  <em>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Babylon 5</a>
  </em>
  and, in a lesser extent, by the historical
  significance of ancient Babylon, which was the cradle of agricultural civilization.
