  ESA has made public a 3D model of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in
  .wrl and .obj formats. This model is based on images taken by the OSIRIS and
  NAVCAM cameras onboard Rosetta. A rendering with <a href="http://threejs.org">Threejs</a>
  is shown above, which is the result of importing the .obj file to Threejs format.
  Orbit controls are enabled, so it is posible to change the perspective with left mouse
  button and mouse wheel. The links to the 3D model files form ESA can be found following
  the link below. Enjoy!
