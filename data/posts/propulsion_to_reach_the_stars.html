  What will propel us to the stars? Currently spacecrafts are fuelled mainly with
  hydrogen and oxygen, which can be obtained from water. But this kind of fuel is not
  suitable to cover the distance between Alpha Centauri and us. Consider the amount of
  fuel necessary to accelerate a ship the size of a city to a speed of 0.1 C, that is,
  30 000 kilometers per second. Refuelling is not an option. After the starship had
  reached it´s cruise velocity, it would consume too much fuel to decelerate, making
  a interstellar pitstop very expensive. Besides, there is no guarantee that we will
  find enough water in interstellar space. So one condition of the interstellar voyage is
  that the starship community has to be self sufficient while the trip lasts.
</p>

<p>
  So the fuel that this voyage requires is one that has a big ratio Energy/mass,
  meaning that a small quantity of fuel will unleash a great amount of energy and,
  further, give a great impulse to the ship. This leaves us with several candidates:
  nuclear fission, nuclear fusion and antimater engines, having the later the best
  efficiency and the former the poorest of the three. We could say that the first two
  are in reach of our current technological level, and the third would need further
  development. This being said, perhaps it makes sense to stick to nuclear fusion as
  our interstellar fuel.

  Nuclear explosions, referred to as nuclear pulses, as a means of space transportation
  was the subject of a research program in the 50´s, called
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)">Project Orion</a>.
  The goal was to develop a spacecraft that could reach the outer
  solar system in a record breaking time. But the project was canceled after a bill
  banned nuclear detonations above earth atmosphere. Still today nuclear pulse rockets
  remains as the most efficient way of space propulsion that is technically feasible.
</p>

<p>
  A nuclear fusion pulse drive can accelerate a starship to 0.1 C or 10% the speed of
  light. It would take about 36 days accelerating at a rate of 1 g or 9.8 m/s2, to achieve
  this velocity. Travelling at 0.1 C it would take around 44 years to get to Alpha
  Centauri. This timespan would require 2 to 3 generations of humans to make it to their
  destination. A 44 year time span posses the following major challenges:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Creating a suitable environment to maintain a thriving society of human
    colonists, and ensure that this environment will remain the whole time of the
    trip (<a href="<?php echo $config['baseURL'] ?>/posts/starship_environment.php">learn more</a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure that the expedition human population remains stable or grows to a safe
    quantity so that when the expedition arrives to it´s destination it can establish a
    thriving colony.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Minor technical challenges are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Develop a damping system such that the accelerating phase of the trip will be
    smooth enough that human travellers are safe and feel confortable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a structure that can withstand the transition between the
    acceleration phase and cruise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Maintaining communication with earth or at least with
    solar system.
  </li>
  <li>Charting space as the voyage progresses.</li>
  <li>
    Manuever the ship during cruise phase, so that it can avoid potential dangers
    without loosing cruise speed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a decelerating system to slow the ship as it approaches it
    destination.
  </li>
  <li>Develop a system to safely switch from cruise phase to deceleration phase.</li>
</ul>
