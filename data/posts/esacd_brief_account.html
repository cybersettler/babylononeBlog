  Last Saturday September 10, 2016, the European Space Agency (ESA) engaged with
  European citizens in a discussion about Space in an event that formally
  received the name of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.citizensdebate.space/">
    <em>Citizens' Debate on Space for Europe</em></a> frequently
  referred to as <em>Citizens' Debate</em> for short.
  The Agency made a public call for European citizens to
  register for the Event, and from those who registered, the Agency selected
  about 2000 participants across 22 different countries.
</p>

<p>
  We had the privilege to participate in the session that took place in
  ESA's facilities in Darmstadt, Germany, and decided to write a brief
  account of the <em>Citizens' Debate on Space</em> as it happened in Darmstadt.
</p>

<p>
  The event was scheduled to start at 9 o'clock, but already at 8:15 there was
  a queue at the entrance of the ESA facility. I was doubting that many people
  would attend the call of ESA, but it turned out that in Darmstadt there
  was a full house, around 100 people attended. The next surprise was that
  Mr. Johann-Dietrich Wörner, ESA's Director General greeted us in the opening
  speech and participated throughout the Event.
</p>

<p>
  After the opening speech, we got ourselves busy with the discussion. The
  general dynamic was as follows: first they would show us a video where
  several European citizens were interviewed with questions regarding the
  topic we would discuss next. All the participants were divided in groups
  with one moderator each. After the video was over, the moderator
  would hand us a questionnaire about the topic. The moderator then
  started a discussion following the questionnaire.
</p>

<p>
  In the discussions several critical topics came up, and the participants
  had frequently well informed opinions about them. This perception seems to
  agree with what the questionnaire outcome shows us, that is half of the
  participants where <em>Space aficionados</em>. Of the topics
  that came up, worth mentioning are:</p>

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    Availability of data generated by space probes.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    Space property and the right to exploit it's resources.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    Space security.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    Space traffic regulations.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    The role of space exploration as motivational driver for Scientific
    and technological development.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    Space tourism.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  At noon we made a break to have lunch, which ESA politely provided for.
  But food was not the only good thing in the break, I also got the
  opportunity to engage in an informal conversation with other participants
  and Mr. Wörner as well. We had a small chat where he explained what the
  <em>Moon Village</em> idea was about.
</p>

<p>
  In the second part of the Event, beside from the questionnaire discussions,
  we were asked to choose between four different scenarios and elaborate over
  them. Our group chose to plan a space mission for 2026. The mission we
  proposed was a space station on the langrangian point L1 between the Earth
  and the Moon to replace the ISS, which will be out of service by that time.
  It turned out that at least another group made the same proposition.
</p>

<p>
  All good things come to an end, but then I wonder if this event was
  instead the beginning of something larger. The <em>Citizens' Debate</em> is
  the first event I know of were a space agency asks it's citizens for
  their opinion. Perhaps the organizers of <em>Citizens' Debate</em> have tapped
  in an unexpected resource. But now the question that keeps coming to
  my mind is how to harness it for the advancement of the space enterprise.
  What will come next?
