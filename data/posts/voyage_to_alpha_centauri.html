<p class="lead">How would a voyage to another stelar system be like? I guess the Interplanetary
  film deals with this matter. The Interstellar travel has been lately on my mind,
  although I haven´t seen the Hollywood feature yet. Thinking about Interstellar travel
  I realised that solving the problem for an interstellar ship would in fact get me
  closer to Babylon 1, the space metropolis. So I decided to post my thoughts on
  interstellar travel as an starting point for Babylon 1.</p>

  <p>The first thing that we may consider is the time it will take humans travelers to
    the closest stellar system. Alpha Centauri is roughly 4 light years away form Earth.
    A light year is a unit of distance, it is the distance light travels in a year. For
    our starship I've picked the propulsion system described in Project Orion, one of
    the fastest and most efficient systems of propulsion that relies on nuclear power.
    With this system our starship could travel ar 10% the speed of light. So let´s
    make a simple calculation that assumes that our starship will travel from the
    Solar system to Alpha Centauri at a constant velocity of 0.1C, being C the speed of
    light. So we have that velocity is the rate at wich our ship moves with respect to time:
  </p>

  <code>v = distance/time</code>

  <p>So the time necessary for our ship to travel to Alpha Centauri is given by:</p>

  <code>travel time = distance/v</code><br />

  <code>travel time = 4.366 years * C / 0.1 C = 43.66 years</code>


  <p>The trip would take about 44 years! That´s a lifetime! Astronauts on such a voyage
    would grow old just travelling, and a new generation would be necessary to colonize
    the new stellar system. This means that our ship would need to be a self supporting
    society with all the necessary means to thrive as an independent civilisation
    and rise a new generation of humans. Now our spaceship faces the similar challenges to
    Babylon 1, and if the star explorers don´t find an earth like planet on Alpha Centauri,
    they would well consider building a colony like Babylon One.</p>
