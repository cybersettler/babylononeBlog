  Something similar can be said about bridges, if there is
  a place to stand, you can build a bridge. But this is here
  on Earth, right? What about space? Are things that different
  in the vacuum that separate planetary bodies?
</p>

<p>
  We should start answering this puzzle by asking yet another
  question: how can we make a standing point in space? Do we need it
  anyway? You could think that there is no need for that because, as
  Isaac Newton taught us, a projectile can be fired from Earth with such
  high speed that it would be perpetually falling to Earth without ever
  reaching the ground. We say that the projectile has achieved orbit. This
  is the case of the International Space Station (ISS), they are in orbit
  around Earth. That means that the ISS and the astronauts inside, are
  always falling, and that's why they are weightless. Is not that Earth's
  gravity is too weak on space, is that they never reach the ground what
  gives them that sensation. The astronauts experience is the same as that
  of the passengers of a roller coaster cart going at full speed down the
  hill. They feel weightless.
</p>

<p>
  So why we need a standing point then? Well weightlessness
  in space can be a problem, specially for human health. And that is the
  problem that this post tries to tackle. The goal is to have an environment
  where humans experience a force that keeps them fixed to the ground and
  prevents them from drifting away. On Earth we call that force gravity. So
  our problem is to somehow generate gravity in space. Maybe this thought
  evokes some fancy mechanism described in the science fiction literature,
  but actually there is a very simple way to generate such force, that is,
  circular motion.

      A simple experiment can demonstrate the power of centrifugal force
      to simulate gravity. If a person holds a bucket with water while
      spinning fast enough, the bucket can be held in an horizontal
      position without spilling its content.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  If you have a bucket with water and grab it by its handle spinning around,
  if you are fast enough, the bucket can be lifted to shoulder's height
  without spilling the water. The so-called centrifugal force keeps
  the water in the bucket pressed against the bottom. The centrifugal force
  will have the same direction as the radius of the circle described by the
  motion, it will lay in the same plane and its direction will be outwards
  of the circle.

      Illustration of artificial gravity in space. Two astronauts stand each
      on a bucket connected by a cable. The system is rotating with uniform
      velocity. The centrifugal force generated by the motion, pulls them
      to the bottom of the bucket in a similar way as gravity would if the
      buckets where standing on Earth.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Now let's imagine we have two giant buckets floating in space
  linked by their handles with a cable. The system is spinning and in each
  bucket there is an astronaut. The two astronauts will experience a force
  that pulls them to the bottom of the bucket. If the buckets are closed and
  spinning at the right speed, they couldn't tell the difference from being
  on Earth. The centrifugal force can thus be used as artificial gravity.
</p>

<p>
  So what has all this to do with bridges? The two buckets system does not
  look like a bridge, but it is not very useful either. Our astronauts
  are very limited in terms of movement and could feel claustrophobic. So
  we would like to build something bigger, perhaps two spaceships the size
  of a small jet plane linked by a cable. The spaceship's floor would have
  to be curved shaped to ensure that as the astronauts move, they would
  experience the same centrifugal force as they move through the vessel.
</p>

<p>
  We still have two problems to solve: the Coriolis effect and the size of
  the space station. The Coriolis effect is responsible for giving weather
  phenomenon their rotational nature on Earth, like hurricanes and cyclones.
  In a rotating frame, the Coriolis effect is perceived as a
  force that prevents moving objects to follow a straight line. The Coriolis
  effect can make our astronauts dizzy, and is reduced by increasing the
  radius of the rotating system and reducing its angular velocity. The
  comfort zone lies beyond 100 m radius and below 2 rpm according to a
  <a
  href="http://space.alglobus.net/papers/RotationPaper.pdf"
  target="_blank">study on rotation tolerance</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The other issue to solve is the habitable size of our space station. The
  problem we face as we make our rotating space capsule longer is that is
  harder to maintain the edges in place. As the capsule is held in a single
  point in the middle by a cable, the edges tend to drift out creating a
  bending effect of the whole structure. And now it starts to look more like
  a "bridge" problem.

<p>
  In the typical bridge you want to build a structure using two standing
  points. In our case we want to build on a single standing point, the
  cable that links our vessels. It turns out that bridges using a single
  standing point has been built, being the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Bridge"
  target="_blank">Ada Bridge</a> in Serbia an example.
  The Ada bridge is what is known as a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge"
  target="_blank">cable-stayed bridge</a>
  with a single pylon. What the cable-stayed system does is that it transfers
  the tensions in the edge of the structure to compression forces in the pylon
  and horizontal compression forces in the deck.
</p>

<p>
  So instead of trying to solve our space habitat problem in an original way,
  we could apply a solution that is known to work here on Earth. Think about it,
  it is the same problem, with the difference that our standing point is the
  cable, but otherwise is the same in practice. We have a structure hanging from
  a single standing point. Let's imagine we have two Ada like bridges connected
  by their single pylons by a sufficiently strong 2 km long cable, rotating
  at a speed of 1.5 rpm. The astronauts on the deck would experience a pull of
  1 g, the same as on Earth. The size of the habitable area is about 300 m long,
  and 50 m wide for each deck, that would amount for a total of 3 hectares.
  Not bad, eh? I call this structure the
