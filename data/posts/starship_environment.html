  A voyage to the nearest star would take around 44 years travelling at
  10% the speed of light, or 0.1C. In order to establish a human colony, the starship
  must provide the conditions necessary for a society to thrive. The travellers
  should be able to rise new generations of settlers, and a minimum population of
  humans should arrive to the new stelar system in order for a colony to thrive.
  In this essay we will address what kind of environment would be suitable in the starship
  for such a human society in order to make it to the next stellar system.
</p>

<p>
  The first thing we could consider is how many people will fit in one ship. The
  total travelling population does not have to be necessarily what a single ship can
  carry, since the enterprise may consist of several starships. This is also convenient
  for redundancy, in case one or more ships fail. On the other hand, it would not be
  efficient to have many arbiltrarilly small ships, since more fuel and structural materials
  are needed.
</p>

<p>
  Also to be considered is what a healthy environment would look like, an environment
  such that a society here on earth would thrive comfortably. At this point we can consider
  many different options, but in order to kickstart the project, or the discussion itself,
  I will pick one community model, that is, Howard´s
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Cities_of_To-morrow">
    <em>Garden Cities of To-morrow</em>
  </a>.
  Howard´s book was written to address the
  poor living quality of the working and unemployed class in XIX century London´s slums.
  At that time, there was a massive migration of population coming from the country to
  London as a result of the industrial revolution. <em>Garden cities of to-morrow</em>
  was published in 1898, and though it may seem useless to regard this book for the
  matter that occupy us, interstellar travel, it is interesting to note that Howard and
  space colonisation engineers face similar problems.
</p>

<p>
  For Howard, the overpopulated London was a result of poor living conditions in the
  country and great opportunities in the big cities. He compared the pros and cons
  of three different environments, the country, the town and the town country. This
  last environment was seen by Howard as an equilibrium point between the town and the
  country, and his proposed <em>Garden City</em> was such an environment. Below we have
  represented Howard´s comparison in a table:

    Some of the conditions Howard aludes are unique to XIX century England. but there are
    also some basic considerations that he makes that should also be taken into account for
    interstellar travel. The main one is health, both physical and psychological. A very
    crowded place without any access to natural areas certainly would pose a health risk
    for our travellers. If we take into account that there will likely be people who start
    the interstellar voyage and remain the rest of their lives in the starship, we would
    realise that such vehicle should be something that people can consider their home.
    The environment in the starship shouldn't be less than a model city.
  </p>

  <p>
    The starship cannot be like a big metropolis, because human travellers will need
    access to natural resources, fresh air, and beautiful lanscapes. It cannot be like the country,
    because people need amusement, social opportunities and some degree of anonymity,
    specially in a space voyage. So we find ourselves in a very similar quest as Ebenezer
    Howard, trying to conceive a habitable space that exhibits the advantages of both, the
    country and the big city, and at the same time mitigates the disadvantages of both.

    Garden City has a population of 32 000 and a total area of 6 000 acres or 2 428
    hectares. Of the 6 000 acres, 1 000 is occupied by the city itself, and 5 000 acres are
    agricultural area. From this figures we can estimate that there is 6 000 / 32 000 acres
    for every person, and 5 000 / 32 000 acres of agricultural land for every person. With
    these ratios we can extrapolate the areas of Garden City to any population.
  </p>

  <p>
    For our starship we could consider that it has to hold at least 32 000 people and
    have a habitable area of at least 6 000 acres. These figures may vary somewhat, but I
    think that if they`re not close to the optimal dimensions, at least they would be a
    lower limit. We are also considering that a single ship would not travel alone. In
    Howard´s book, Garden City was part of a network of six other similar cities, and
    a bigger central city with a population of 58 000 people. In total this system would
    comprise 66 000 acres and 250 000 people.
